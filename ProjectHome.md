This project hosts Vaadin Add-on that contains two upload related components:
  * UploadField : and upload component that can be used like any other field in a form
  * MultiFileUpload : an upload component that supports sending multiple files at once (both with drag and drop and with OS dialog). For IE there is a flash fallback that used swfuploads)
